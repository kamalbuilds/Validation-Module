To utilize session keys in a blockchain context, we require a smart contract that verifies whether a given user operation adheres to the permissions defined within the session key and confirms that the operation has been appropriately signed by the said session key.

Example:

### Title of Project
- Two line brief of your project
- Link to any github repositories
- Link to working demo (if not deployed link to video)
- Members of team you worked with
